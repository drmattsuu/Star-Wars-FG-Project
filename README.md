# Star-Wars-FG-Project
Project dedicated to recreating and enhancing the Fantasy Flight Star Wars RPGs inside the Fantasy Grounds software.

Instructions to compile this project;
Prereq: At least 1 Full version of the Fantasy Grounds software (sold seperately), The FGPEM Utility (included in this repo)
1) Compile the Library folder as a `.mod` and the ruleset folder as a `.pak` using the FGPEM Utility provided
2) Place the `.mod` in %appdata%/fantasygrounds/modules
3) Place the `.pak` in %appdata%/fantasygrounds/rulesets

It is intended that this mod is used to supplement the core rulebooks and shouldn't attempt to play without the source material as this project simply implements the base mechanics, and includes some basic commonly used items in the library.

Massive thanks Trenloe on the Fantasy grounds forums for doing the initial work with the ruleset that allowed me to get into this quickly for my own RP Group.
